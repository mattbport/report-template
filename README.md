# Style guide and template

Style guide and template for written work on the BSc (Hons) and BA (Hons) Creative Computing courses at the University of Portsmouth.

The template makes use of Pandoc, LaTeX and BibTeX. You will need to install Pandoc and LaTeX, and a reference/citation manager which either works with, or can output, BibTeX files. If in doubt, try Zotero. All the software you need runs on Mac, Windows and Linux.
